# Recursive-Chaos-Cryptography-via-the-Collatz-Conjecture
The Hailstone System v4.1 is a recursive substitution cipher using the Collatz Conjecture ($3n+1$) as its engine. It leverages the chaotic nature of "hailstone paths" to turn plaintext into high-entropy numerical streams. By blending deterministic math with key-dependent masking, it resists frequency analysis better than standard ciphers
